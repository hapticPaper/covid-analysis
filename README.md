#covidData


This code will help load the data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports into a postgres database. 

Data loaders for NYC MTA data from http://web.mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html#data have been added. 

Clone both repos, and edit the config in this one.
